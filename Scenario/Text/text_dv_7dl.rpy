    "So the evening school, the eleventh grade - where I was the youngest, and my desk neighbor most often was a certain Dementich - a kind-hearted person, the head of one workshop in a printing house, with whose light hand I once got a job there."
    "Computers, of course, did not smell of anything, most of the prints had to be typed by hand - but I felt that I was doing the right, useful thing - unlike dozens of orders hastily filled on the computer, which I traded in my old life."
    "There was an incentive to grow and develop - always at hand, such a redhead, restless. The guardians really wanted to arrange her either on a collective farm or somewhere else in the region, to engage in machine milking. Definitely necessary, but not in the case of my Dvachevskaya."
    "I turned out to be right - it was a completely different world, there was no smell of perestroika and glasnost here, the Union stood and was going to stand for a very long time."

    "But, looking closely, spat in my hearts."
    "Now I myself saw that the shirt was dirty, there were mourning stains on the collar, and the scarf was not red, and there was no pioneer enthusiasm in the eyes - the mummer was thin and sad."
    "Three points - a cafe, a smoking room, a waiting room. An endless number of coiled circles in anticipation. In an indifferent, doomed expectation."
    "And the Nasovites sent their Voskhod to Ceres, and it seems they even found water there."
    "But in Ukraine they were shooting, but in the rest of Europe they didn't know who to support."
    "And Hollywood has already filmed the seventh Fast and the Furious, which no one will watch anyway, just as no one will play the next Call of Duty, and all this is pure money laundering."
    "And the Earth did not stumble upon the celestial axis, and there was no abocralipsis."
    "Absolutely everything around, every advertisement, style of clothing, people's speech and their behavior - all this convinced me that I was at home. On the twenty-eighth of February, two thousand and nineteen."
    "Houses."
    "Houses."
    "But isn't home where your heart is?"
    "And looking at the next train taking people towards happiness, grief - life - I just could not bring myself to voice the obvious question:"
    th "Is it good that I remembered everything?"
    "Because it is logically followed by a much more important one:"
    th "Was it worth it to leave?"
    "Now I could open Skype, dial an interlocutor and voice a whole bunch of signs, descriptions, names ..."
    "But why?"
    "I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not, because judging by where the guitar pick is stored, this isn't the first time this has happened."
    "Did I choose to forget everything? Did I choose this option?"
    "It's so much like me. The real question is, was it worth it to try to leave the camp? Leave, run away. Leave."
    "I'm just a cheap escapist."
    "I know a secret kung fu move called 'head in the sand'."
    "And I can't, I just can't do anything - neither by myself, nor in the crowd, nor with an incentive, nor out of harm."
